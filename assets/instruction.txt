Development of a Wizard to upload jpg images from local drive to local browser

http://camanjs.com/examples/

and align based on the resolution of the active display. 
The wizard needs to be implemented responsive. ok

The visible part of the image is in a square of constant size. 
Inside this square, a rectangle representing the screen resolution is drawn. As screen does, 
in general, have not the same number of pixels horizontal and vertical 2 sides of the rectangle are different from the square. 
The user can via drag move the visible part of the image. 
Scaling of the image needs to be possible.

The wizard has 3 steps / tabs. Going forward and backward needs to be possible.
The following parameters are on each tab:
1) Base Data:
- Select image
- Display resolution of display
- Display resolution of image
- Drag visible part of image

2) Overlay Data:
- Little image preloaded (circle of constant size) on overlay
- Select size of circle (50%,100%,200%
- Allow position of circle over image

3) Upload:
- email of the user with regex for basic checks
- Botton “Complete”

After clicking on Complete a JS function should be called. Some data needs to be available in this function: x,y,dx,dy,circlex,circley,cireclesize.

For the image processing part, I think CamanJS would be a good choice as layers are supported.
